## Technology Stack

- **HTML**: We will use BEM (Block Element Modifier) methodology to structure the HTML code.
- **CSS**: We will write the CSS code using LESS, a preprocessor that extends the functionality of CSS.
- **Gulp**: We will use Gulp, a task runner, to automate tasks such as preprocessing the CSS code for deployment.

## Installation

### First Install the NPM Packages

Open your terminal or command prompt.
Navigate to the root directory of your project.
Run the following command to install all of the required packages as development dependencies in your project:

```
npm i
```

Wait for the installation to complete. You should see a progress indicator in your terminal as each package is installed.

That's it! You can now use these packages in your Gulpfile to automate your build process.
